`codex-collaboration-harness` is a small, domain-neutral Python reference
implementation for coordinating delegated agent work without transferring the
parent mission to a worker.

The harness models one closed collaboration cycle:

```text
mission -> first false predicate -> bounded task packet -> lease/CAS claim
        -> step/effect ledger -> execution result -> terminal receipt
        -> destination-bound callback with delivery reconciliation
        -> convergence proof -> mission verification or route selection
```

It is intentionally an in-memory reference, not an agent runtime, workflow
service, sandbox, durable queue, or authorization system. Integrators provide
the actual worker, persistence, effect, and callback adapters.

The package also includes a first-class, transport-neutral
[`TuraAdapter`](src/codex_collaboration_harness/adapters/tura.py). It turns the
generic task/lease contract into a bounded Tura request and maps a third-party
Tura terminal envelope back into the core result/failure model. No private
endpoint, credential, UTM shape, or Tura runtime source is required by the
Python package.

For full-stack review, the repository also binds the
[public AGPL runtime fork](https://github.com/nokiyliao/tura)
through [`components/tura-runtime.json`](components/tura-runtime.json). The
manifest deliberately separates the public source ref, the benchmarked
candidate, and any installed/running claim. See
[`docs/full-stack-profile.md`](docs/full-stack-profile.md).

## Why It Exists

Agent collaboration often treats a completed child task as proof that the
parent goal is complete. That shortcut loses mission ownership, makes retries
ambiguous, and can duplicate effects. This project makes the missing control
edges explicit and testable:

- the parent owns an ordered list of measurable exit predicates;
- only the first false predicate is eligible for work;
- a task packet carries a bounded route and abandon condition;
- a lease and compare-and-swap version protect the declared scope;
- a worker result is converted into a typed terminal receipt that releases the
  exact task lease;
- an unsettled effect can be reconciled on the same attempt without executing
  the worker again;
- typed blockers can receive model-generated recovery proposals, but a
  deterministic gate enforces the parent packet's scope, authority, effect,
  destination, predicate, verification plan, and recovery budget;
- continuation targets an exact destination and request identity; a delivery
  that may have committed cannot retry until an authoritative absence or
  convergence proof reconciles that same request;
- callback, receipt, and continuation ACK identities are created only after
  convergence;
- every mission verification consumes a complete parent snapshot with a
  monotonic state sequence, so older truth cannot overwrite newer truth;
- route disposition and supersession remain parent-authored evidence rather
  than worker authority;
- control returns to parent mission verification or route selection.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Python 3.11 or newer. Runtime code uses only the Python standard
library.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nokiyliao/codex-collaboration-harness.git
cd codex-collaboration-harness
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The test suite is the canonical executable contract. It includes a deterministic
in-memory end-to-end cycle and negative or recovery cases for stale mission/CAS
state, duplicate dispatch, overlapping leases, pre-execution rejection,
unsettled effects, callback mismatch/reconciliation, stale parent snapshots,
bounded recovery, route disposition, missing convergence, and replay. It
uses no network, credentials, private corpus, or external agent service.

Run only the complete public cycle with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest \
  tests.test_harness.HappyPathTests.test_complete_cycle -v
```

Until a release is installed, the source-tree equivalent is:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

There is no CLI or daemon in the reference package. Start with the public
objects exported by `codex_collaboration_harness`; see
[`docs/verification.md`](docs/verification.md) for the exact verification
contract and [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the lifecycle.

The primary API is `CollaborationHarness`. Its explicit stages include `plan`,
`claim`, `execute`, effect reconciliation, continuation/ACK, and
`verify_mission`; `run` composes one complete settled cycle. The worker's
`predicate_satisfied` field is advisory. Only an exact parent-owned
`MissionSnapshotReadback` may change mission truth. `Executor` and
`ContinuationTransport` are adapter protocols. All public evidence records are
immutable dataclasses, and `InMemoryStore` is a deterministic reference store
rather than production persistence.

For a repository-level review, including provenance, public-data hygiene,
tests, the synthetic demo, and import smoke check, run:

```bash
make check
```

Networked verification of the public Tura component ref, exact Git trees,
ancestry, license, and modification notice is deliberately separate:

```bash
make check-components
```

The packaged protocol schemas and cross-language golden vectors live under
[`src/codex_collaboration_harness/protocol`](src/codex_collaboration_harness/protocol).
Both request and terminal envelopes are bound to
`protocol_version=tura-collaboration/v1`.

## What Is Verified

The public suite verifies the state-machine and ownership invariants implemented
by this repository. A passing run means the in-memory reference behaved as
specified for those fixtures. It does **not** prove:

- durable or distributed lease safety;
- cryptographic receipt authenticity;
- exactly-once delivery across process or network failures;
- correct authorization for real tools or irreversible effects;
- isolation of an external worker;
- compatibility with every Codex or third-party runtime;
- the results of the non-public internal benchmark described in this repo.

Read [`docs/trust-boundaries.md`](docs/trust-boundaries.md) before adapting the
reference to production effects.

## Project Status

This is an early reference implementation. The API may change before a stable
release. Source acceptance, a packaged candidate, installed adoption, and a
real runtime integration are separate states and must not be inferred from one
another.

## Provenance and Affiliation

The code in this repository is an original, from-scratch, domain-neutral
reference implementation. It is informed by prior work with collaboration
runtimes and evidence systems, but it does not contain private task corpora,
raw conversations, local session identities, protected runtime receipts, or
source copied from those systems. See [`docs/provenance.md`](docs/provenance.md).

This is an independent project. It is not an official OpenAI product and is not
endorsed by OpenAI. "Codex" identifies the intended collaboration context; no
OpenAI source code is included.
